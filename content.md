# Ruby Array

Work with lists of data in Ruby using the Array class.

## Goal

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to *create*, *add*, *retrieve*, and *use* data from arrays in Ruby.

## What is an Array?

An array is a list. Think of it like a row of boxes, each holding an item. You can add more boxes, take things out, and check what's inside.

In Ruby, arrays can hold any type of objectâ€”numbers, strings, even other arrays.

  Arrays are one of the most common data structures in programming, you'll use them almost everywhere.

## Create an Empty Array

We can create a new empty array with `Array.new`:

```ruby
foods = Array.new
pp foods.class
pp foods
```
{: .repl }

<aside class="tip">
  Ruby represents an Array with square brackets, <code>[]</code>.
</aside>

## Add Items with `push`

Let's put some foods into our array using [push](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Array.html#method-i-push):

```ruby
foods = Array.new

foods.push("Pizza")
foods.push("Sushi")
pp foods 
```
{: .repl }

<aside class="tip">
  Try adding more food items to the <code>foods</code> array using the <code>push</code> method.
</aside>

## Shortcut with Array Literals

Instead of using `Array.new` + `push`, we can write arrays directly with square brackets. We can type an array "literal" directly into the code:

```ruby
foods = ["Pizza", "Sushi", "Pineapple"]
pp foods
```
{: .repl }

### Get Items with `at` or `[]`

We can grab items by their position (index). Ruby starts counting at 0.

```ruby
foods = ["Pizza", "Sushi", "Pineapple", "Curry", "Sandwich"]

pp foods.at(0)   # First item
pp foods.at(2)   # Third item
pp foods.at(-1)  # Last item
```
{: .repl }

Syntax Sugar: use square brackets `[]` instead of `at`.

```ruby
foods = ["Pizza", "Sushi", "Pineapple", "Curry", "Sandwich"]

pp foods[0]   # "Pizza"
pp foods[2]   # "Pineapple"
pp foods[-2]  # "Curry"
```
{: .repl }

## `first` and `last`

Ruby has shortcuts to grab the first or last item:

```ruby
foods = ["Pizza", "Sushi", "Pineapple", "Curry", "Sandwich"]

pp foods.first
pp foods.last
```
{: .repl }

## `count`

How many items are in an array?

```ruby
a = [8, 3, 1, 19, 23, 3]

pp a.count

pp a.count(3)
```
{: .repl }

## Random Items with `sample`

Pick a random element from an array. Each time you run it, you may get a different result.

```ruby
an_array = [8, 3, 1, 19, 23, 3]

pp an_array.sample
```
{: .repl }

## `min`, `max`, and `sum`

Ruby can do simple math on arrays of numbers:

```ruby
a = [8, 3, 1, 19, 23, 3]

pp a.min
pp a.max
pp a.sum
```
{: .repl }

## Quiz

```ruby
foods = ["Pizza", "Sushi", "Curry"]
pp foods.at(1)
```

- What does this code print?
- "Pizza"
  - Not correct. Remember, arrays start at index 0.
- "Sushi"
  - Correct! Index 1 is the second item.
- "Curry"
  - Not correct. That's index 2.
